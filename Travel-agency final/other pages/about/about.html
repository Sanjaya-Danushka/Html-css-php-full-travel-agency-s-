            <h3> Our Story <i class="fa-brands fa-pagelines"></i></i></h3>
            <p><br>In 2022, Travel Bee took flight, piloted by Sanjaya, our CEO and Founder, with the main aim of becoming
                the best personalised travel agent in the world! This one-man show quickly gathered speed as the team at
                travel Bee grew, fast and wide. Travel Bee, spearheaded by Ravi, grew faster by attracting the right
                people
                around him. An integral part of our growth lies with listening to our customers valuable feedback and
                improving
                ourselves, where we compete with ourselves every day!<br><br>

                Sri Lanka was the main and primary destination to conquer. Our brand started to gain its momentum
                worldwide
                as the reliable online travel partner for booking personalised tours to Sri Lanka. This brought us
                recognition
                and fame, from our clientele, who simply loved our genuine services. Through our customer referrals and
                online fame,
                we were able to expand and offer our services to other amazing destinations across the globe!<br><br>

                assisting them
                in every possible way is the most important part of our brand.

                We believe in equality for all, and hence our team is now made up of 75% female staff! In addition, by
                creating countless
                opportunities for the younger generation, we contribute to empowering the youth who will take the
                company to its future.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
